Freelancing is a great choice for skilled individuals, to make use of their free time while doing something useful and gaining both experience and some side money. Unsuprisingly, some freelancers are full time now !
Both the IT sector and the creative services have especially accomodated freelancing as a viable choice. It can be evident as to why that is the case, as the medium is entirely digital and not bound by physical constraints. Engineering, on the other, has a hands-on aspect and as such: Can a *mechanical* engineer provide be a self-employed remote contractor? And in which cases?   

# A look at the freelancing contract  
Many websites offer intermediaries between the employers and the freelancers, such as
[Upwork](https://www.upwork.com), [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com)...

First of all, you must have a valid profile with a formal diploma (*so so for IT, but engineering is not as forgiving*). Secondly, you must build a strong portfolio geared toward a specific area of your choosing. Then, you can browse jobs chosen for their relevance to your profile (use keywords too). Once you find a suitable job, you can apply and wait for the employer to contact you. Once that is done, you can freely discuss how to establish your work contract with the employer.

We'll go through ways to make this profile stand out in subsequent articles, but the most important thing is that you know what you can and want to do, and direct all your focus and energy on that specific area !

## What you can do

Browsing through the job list at Upwork, some job categories are more prevalent -*for good reason*- than others. I will list the most interesting categories in that respective order:

- CAD Modeling (Solidworks, Catia, Fusion 360...)
- FEA (Ansys, Abaqus...)
- CFD (Fluent...)
- Product design
- Thermal analysis
- Technical writing
- Plant design

These jobs, if described properly by the client, can all be done remotely with very satisfactory results. A mechanical engineer is supposed to be able to understand the intricacies of all these categories, however as your freelancing journey goes, choose one and be good at it.

## Certification

No matter what your experience is, and no matter how good you may be at your job, it helps a lot to get a formal certification to enhance and confirm your profile. For instance, if you are a CAD modeler, then go for a certification of your proferred software.

### Example: Solidworks certification

**Simulation Certifications**
These certifications focus on SolidWorks Simulation tools for analysis.

1. **Certified SolidWorks Simulation Associate (CSWA-S)**
   - **Focus Areas:**
     - Basic simulation concepts (e.g., static analysis).
   - **Prerequisites:** CSWA.

2. **Certified SolidWorks Simulation Professional (CSWP-S)**
   - **Focus Areas:**
     - Advanced simulation techniques (e.g., thermal, frequency analysis).
   - **Prerequisites:** CSWP.

**Specialty Certifications**
1. **Certified Additive Manufacturing Associate (CSWA-AM)**
   - **Focus Areas:**
     - 3D printing and additive manufacturing basics.

2. **Certified Sustainable Design Associate (CSWA-SD)**
   - **Focus Areas:**
     - Environmental impact analysis of designs.

**Certification Pathways**
1. **Beginner Level:**
   - CSWA → CSWA-S or CSWA-AM
2. **Intermediate Level:**
   - CSWP → CSWPA (specialized certifications)
3. **Advanced Level:**
   - CSWE (requires 4 CSWPA certifications)

**Exam Details**
- **Format:** Online, proctored.
- **Scoring:** Pass/fail based on percentage.
- **Platform:** SolidWorks Certification Center.
- **Cost:** Varies, typically $99–$199 per exam.

Choose either the first or second pathway (if you have no prior certification) depending on your skills, and study for the Solidworks exam. Note that you will have to invest in this certificate, however it will hopefully pay for itself in the future.

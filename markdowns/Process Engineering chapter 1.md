Chemicals are a backbone of our modern society. Polymers are made from basic molecules such as Ethylene ($ C_2 H_4 $). Pharmaceuticals rely heavily on advanced molecules in order to achieve a set of functions. Doctors use liquid oxygen ($O_2$) for artificial breathing. Soap is also a modern commodity produced through basic processes. All these chemicals, which are taken nowadays for granted, are the products of advanced processes that are engineered to meet tight restrictions while still being economically viable. In this short notes, we'll set about exploring the fascinating world of process engineering.

# Chemical products types

Chemical products fall under one of three categories:

- Bulk chemicals: Produced in larger volumes, and are based on composition, purity and price. Examples include Hydrogen Chloride ($ HCl $) and [Sulfuric Acid](/post/processengineeringterms#sulfuric-acid) ($ Sulfuric Acid $)
- Fine chemicals: Like bulk chemicals, are based on composition, purity and price. They are mostly destined for the industry and are thus produced in lower volumes. Chloropropylene oxide used to manufacture epoxy resins falls under this category.
- Specialty -function- chemicals: These are based on their function and less on composition. For instance, perfumes and pharmaceuticals are function chemicals.

While bulk and fine chemicals are undifferentiated (two products from two manufacturers cannot be distinguished ideally), specialty chemicas are differentiated.

Commodity products have wide range of applciations and do not tend to loose market even when patent expires, in contrast to fine and specialty chemicals.

Chemicals are a backbone of our modern society. Polymers are made from basic molecules such as Ethylene ($ C_2 H_4 $). Pharmaceuticals rely heavily on advanced molecules in order to achieve a set of functions. Doctors use liquid oxygen ($O_2$) for artificial breathing. Soap is also a modern commodity produced through basic processes. All these chemicals, which are taken nowadays for granted, are the products of advanced processes that are engineered to meet tight restrictions while still being economically viable. In this short notes, we'll set about exploring the fascinating world of process engineering.

# Chemical products types

## Product Types
Chemical products fall under one of three categories:

- Bulk chemicals: Produced in larger volumes, and are based on composition, purity and price. Examples include Hydrogen Chloride ($ HCl $) and [Sulfuric Acid](/post/processengineeringterms#sulfuric-acid) ($ Sulfuric Acid $)
- Fine chemicals: Like bulk chemicals, are based on composition, purity and price. They are mostly destined for the industry and are thus produced in lower volumes. Chloropropylene oxide used to manufacture epoxy resins falls under this category.
- Specialty -function- chemicals: These are based on their function and less on composition. For instance, perfumes and pharmaceuticals are function chemicals.

## Economics

While bulk and fine chemicals are undifferentiated (two products from two manufacturers cannot be distinguished ideally), specialty chemicals are differentiated.

Commodity products have wide range of applications and do not tend to loose market even when patent expires, in contrast to fine and specialty chemicals.

Specialty products focus more on the product rather than the process, and sell in lower volumes.

# Chemical manufacturing process

Process engineering is a branch of engineering focused on designing, optimizing and implementing processes that transform raw materials into a finished product.

Chemical process engineering is one branch of process engineering. A chemical process consists of the following:

## Continuous vs Batch

Continuous process, as their name implies, run on a continuous product lifecycle. Batch processes however, are made of semi-continuous processes (such as pumping, heating) and batch steps (feeding stock, quenching reactor).

## Comparison

| Feature            | Continuous Process                                  | Batch Process                                      |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Material flows continuously through the system.  | Materials are processed in fixed, separate batches. |
| **Production Scale** | Large-scale, high-volume production.             | Small to medium-scale production.               |
| **Efficiency**     | High efficiency, minimal downtime.                | Lower efficiency due to setup and cleaning times. |
| **Flexibility**    | Less flexible; difficult to change product types. | High flexibility; easy to switch products.      |
| **Consistency**    | High consistency and uniform product quality.     | Slight variations between batches.              |
| **Capital Cost**   | High initial investment for automation and setup. | Lower initial cost but higher per-unit costs.   |
| **Operating Cost** | Lower per-unit cost due to continuous operation.  | Higher per-unit cost due to downtime and labor. |
| **Example Industries** | Oil refining, petrochemicals, steel production. | Pharmaceuticals, specialty chemicals, food production. |
| **Quality Control** | Real-time monitoring and automation.              | Easier quality checks before releasing each batch. |
| **Energy Consumption** | More energy-efficient over time.                 | Higher energy consumption due to repeated startups. |

# Polymer Fundamentals

Polymers are an important facade for a mechanical engineer's work. They have evolved a lot, and so did their field of applications. A mechanical engineer, in this fashion, has to understand various chemical and structural characteristics and their effects on polymer behavior.  

## Fundamentals

**Poly**-mers, is a large molecule of **repeating** units called monomers.   

### Types

For many centuries, *only* natural polymers were used. Wood, *rubber*, cotton and leather are examples of these natural polymers. We can also list organic polymers, such as proteins, in this category.

It is only after the second world war that the *synthetic* polymers were ever produced. These came with superior characteristics fine tuned for a specific application, and were derived from small organic molecules. Plastics such as polyethylene -PE- is one obvious example.

### Hydrocarbon molecules fundamentals

These are molecules composed exclusively of Hydrogen and Carbon atoms. Most polymers are organic and most organic materials are hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the bonds are covalent, i.e. through sharing of electrons. 

A Carbon atom can share up to four electrons, while a hydrogen has one. Thus, Methane ($ CH_4 $) for instance can be formed with one carbon and four hydrogen atoms.

Methane has four single covalent bonds (each atom contributes exactly one atom). It is also possible to have double covalent bonds (or even triple) as in Ethylene ($ C_2 H_4 $).

For a molecule to be **saturated**, it has to consist only of single bonds. By this definition, it may not accept other atoms without removal of some of its own. Otherwise, it is named **unsaturated**.

| Name    | Molecule     |
|---------|--------------|
| Methane | $ CH_4 $     |
| Ethane  | $ C_2 H_6 $  |
| Propane | $ C_3 H_8 $  |
| Butane  | $ C_4 H_{10} $ |


These are some of the simple saturated hydrocarbons commonly found in nature. Note that these molecules are linked with weak bonds (hydrogen and Van der Walls) and as such have lower boiling points.

#### Acyclic

The general formula for acyclic (non-ring) saturated hydrocarbons is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂, where 'n' represents the number of carbon atoms. This formula applies to both straight-chain and branched alkanes. For example, methane (CH₄) is the simplest alkane, followed by ethane (C₂H₆), propane (C₃H₈), and butane (C₄H₁₀).

#### Alkanes

Alkanes can also form cyclic structures, known as cycloalkanes, which have the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. In these compounds, carbon atoms are arranged in a ring, but like their acyclic counterparts, all bonds are single, maintaining saturation. An example is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), where six carbon atoms form a ring.

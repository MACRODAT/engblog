# Angular momentum

The angular momentum for rotation is analogous to the linear momentum for linear movement. For a point mass, it is expressed as:

$$
  \vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p}
$$

Where $ \vec{r} $ is the vector from the origin to the point mass and $p$ is the linear momentum of the particle.

Since $ \vec{L} $ is a vector, it has a direction and a magnitude. Let's first explore what happens when it changes magnitude, but not the direction. Consider the spinning particle in figure (1), this corresponds to an increase in vector length when the particle accelerates.

## Constant Angular momentum $L$
$\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

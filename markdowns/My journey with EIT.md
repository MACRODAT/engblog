# My journey with EIT
Study without desire spoils the memory, and it retains nothing that it takes in.

Since graduating from naval academy -*with an engineering degree*-, I've always missed the joy of studying and learning new things. Working as an engineer wasn't exactly easy, but slowly but surely I felt some of the stuff was slipping away. 

One day, I stumbled upon a TEDx riddle video. I used to solve these for fun, and was good at that. But no matter what I did, I could not direct my focus on solving the riddle. I kept going back and forth in the video without making progress. That's when I learned about *neuroplasticity*, which happens as the brain stops being simulated to grow new connections. Essentially, it loses its ability to adapt to new problems.

The idea of losing both my sharp reasoning as well as the engineering knowledge which I entertained for many years was scary for me. So I decided to go over my study materials as best as I could. However, as 'Tim Urban' correctly deduced, it's always a challenge to achieve goals when we are pressed to do so, even worse when no deadline is given. I needed to find a way to properly channel my energy and, perhaps, gaining a diploma while doing that. That would help me on a personal note as well as professionally.

Thus I set about finding an engineering diploma which can be worked at a leisurely pace and online (*or without mandatory attendance*). I soon found out that almost no engineering degrees were available online, and the couple that were available were not accredited by any means. As I started to lose hope, I decided in a last attempt to forgo some of my initial criteria about region and language. That's when I found out about **EIT**, which *cherry on top* was specialized in online delivery of engineering degrees.

Most of the degrees were accredited, but my main focus (*mechanical engineering*) had only provisional accreditation in the sense that it was newly offered. Edit: Engineers Australia conducted a formal examination late 2024, so I am positive it will achieve full accreditation soon.

As I started studying, I soon realized some that parts of my initial plan were simply fanciful. Having to work full time, studying and preparing for my exams and dealing with other stuff in life were excrutiatingly difficult. It was apparent that my schedule with EIT should be eased. Luckily, they were understanding and flexible in offering a relaxed schedule.

As I was working as a naval engineer (*with engines, heat exchangers, etc..*), some of the stuff I encountered and could not explain before suddenly started clicking in. Things like why some ships complained about performance issues when they were in a certain region. It was correctly assumed that was due to the higher water temperature, but they missed the fact that the water there was fouling the heat exchangers. Likewise, working with machinery certainly helped grasp not only some of the theoretical stuff, but more importantly, what is the *point* of studying that in the first place.

Finally, studying and having fun at the same time opened my eyes for many aspects of engineering which I liked more. My hope after having my *second* engineering degree is to start a new career as a systems engineer, which is more broad, satisfying, and aligns with my preference of designing systems instead of being a supervisor. 

If you've read this far, you're obviously in agreement with some the ideas in my post. My advice: never ever stop satisfying your natural curiosity for learning new stuff !

Since graduating from the naval academy with an engineering degree, I’ve always missed the joy of studying and learning new things. Working as an engineer wasn’t easy, but over time, I started to feel like some of my knowledge was slipping away.

One day, I stumbled upon a *TEDx* riddle video. I used to solve these riddles for fun and was pretty good at them. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t focus on solving this one. I kept rewinding the video, stuck in a loop, unable to make progress. That’s when I learned about **neuroplasticity** —the brain’s ability to grow new connections when stimulated. Without regular challenges, this adaptability weakens, making it harder to tackle new problems.

The idea of losing both my sharp reasoning skills and the engineering knowledge I’d cultivated over the years terrified me. So, I decided to revisit my old study materials. However, as Tim Urban (*Inside the mind of a master procrastinator*) aptly observed, achieving goals without a set deadline is incredibly hard—and even harder when there’s no external pressure to succeed. I needed a structured way to focus my energy and, ideally, a path that would also enhance my professional credentials.

I began searching for an engineering diploma program that I could complete online and at my own pace. To my dismay, almost no engineering degrees were available through distance study, and the few that existed lacked recognition. Just as I was about to give up, I decided to broaden my search criteria, loosening restrictions on region and language. That’s when I discovered EIT, an institution specializing in the online delivery of engineering degrees.

Most of their programs were *accredited*, but my focus—mechanical engineering—was only provisionally accredited, as it had been newly introduced. (Engineers Australia conducted a formal review in late 2024, and I’m optimistic it will soon gain full accreditation.)

Once I started studying, I quickly realized that parts of my initial plan were overly optimistic or simply fanciful. Balancing full-time work, studying for exams, and managing life’s other demands proved excruciatingly difficult. It became clear that I needed a more flexible schedule with EIT. Fortunately, they were incredibly accommodating, allowing me to pace my studies in a way that suited my circumstances.

As a naval engineer working with engines, heat exchangers, and similar machinery, I began noticing connections between theory and practice. For instance, I had always heard about performance issues on ships operating in certain regions. While many assumed the culprit was higher water temperatures, they overlooked how fouling in the heat exchangers compounded the problem. Studying at EIT not only clarified such concepts but also helped me understand the practical value of what I was learning.

Combining work with study reignited my passion for engineering and introduced me to areas I found even more fascinating. My hope, once I’ve earned my second engineering degree, is to transition into a career as a systems engineer. This broader field aligns with my interests in designing integrated systems rather than focusing solely on supervisory roles.

If you’ve read this far, it’s safe to say you resonate with some of the ideas I’ve shared. My advice: **never stop feeding your natural curiosity**. The joy of learning is a gift that keeps giving—don’t let it slip away!
